            As decades passed by and society evolved itself, a large amount of languages and cultures have come to be and the widely differing nature of these have led to constant, inevitable clashes between them. In 1991, Mary Louise Pratt defined this phenomena as contact zone and accurately articulated what the term means:
            “I use this term to refer to social spaces where cultures meet, clash, and grapple with each other, often in contexts of highly asymmetrical relations of power, such as colonialism, slavery, or their aftermaths as they are lived out in many parts of the world today.” Since then, numerous stories have addressed the issue in clearer contexts and we observe how the authors deal with it in three different stories below.

            In the poem Three Ways Of Speaking English demonstrates how the manner of speaking a language can yield different results. This is, today, sometimes, referred to as accents (a specific manner of speech in a particular place). Moreover, when you are at work or when you are talking to your professors, the type of English used is called professional English. This includes the use of “Sir” and other words similar to it. Colloquial english widely uses sentences like “What's up bro...”. As such the reason for Jamila Lyiscott writing that she was trilingual in her resume is because each manner of speech is categorised as a different language. Once again, the reasoning behind the use of these types of English is related to the power held by the person during that moment. For example we use formal English when speaking to a professor to show sign of respect as an obvious difference in power and authority compels us to do so. The phrase “But I’m here to tell you that even articulate Americans sound foolish to the British.” in Jamila Lyiscott’s poem is a clear indication that it is the majority who decides which type of English is right. Everyone’s assumption that English originates from the latter’s country creates an unspoken rule that the latter’s english is the correct way.

            Furthermore in Amy Tan’s Mother Tongue, the concept of contact zone manifests itself in the form of a clash of language when she pretends to be her mother over the phone. “When I was fifteen, she used to have me call people on the phone to pretend I was she” Interestingly, we can argue that the different type of spoken english warrants for an asymmetrical power play as Amy Tan’s mother’s broken english, that is so different from the majority, allows the latter to belittle the former. Indeed, when Amy Tan and her mother went to get her CAT scan, the doctor only spoke to Amy because she spoke and understood standard English. But Amy is not immune to the pressures of contact zone, either, though hers is evident due to her origin that creates an outlet for racial stereotyping when she is pressured to take math and science classes and is dissuaded from pursuing a language class, simply because she is Asian. Unfortunately, this type of mentality still persists and one has to be hard-headed as Amy to pursue personal passion and block unwanted input.

            Basically what I’m saying is that contact zones are omnipresent in all parts of the world. Whilst, most consequences resulting from decisions taken in response to contact zones are negative (as shown in the stories), it would be biased to ignore the positives (such as invoking the desire to learn a foreign language) that have resulted. For example, in “How To Tame A Wild Tongue”, the contact zone between English and Spanish leads to the creation of a new language known as Chicano Spanish. Even if the reasons for its inception, supposedly “for people who cannot entirely identify with either standard Spanish nor standard English” and to avoid “cultural traitors”, from speaking the oppressor's’ language by speaking English” and “ruining the Spanish language” are negative, the outcome has been interestingly satisfying. A new language was born and along with it, the creation of a new culture.

            But that’s not all. In The Mother Tongue, we could see all the pressure and challenges that Amy Tan has to overcome due to the racial stereotyping. However in the end, she became a writer and even published her book. Moverover she even wrote one that was dedicated to her mother and those like her. Likewise in Three Ways Of Speaking English, Jamila Lyiscott considers the different ways of speaking as unique languages and for that reason considers herself as a trilingual.

            In the end, contact zones are just like any other experiences that you may face in life. It is up to the individual to decide how to react when it occurs. And if these events does turn out to be unwanted or saddening, we just have to ignore and move on like Amy Tan did when discouraged from pursuing language courses or use them to your advantage like Jamila Lyiscott
